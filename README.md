1. Exceptional Weather Forecast
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to enhance your understanding of exception handling by creating a weather forecast application that gracefully handles unexpected user input and provides user-friendly error messages.

Task 1: Start
Begin by setting up a simple user input loop that asks the user to enter the temperature in Fahrenheit.

Ensure that your program only accepts numerical input and provides a friendly error message if the user enters something that can't be converted to a number.

Task 2: Temperature Conversion
Write a function that converts the Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius. Remember that the formula is (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9.

Use a try block to catch any potential errors during the conversion process, such as division by zero or overflow errors.

Task 3: User Experience
Implement an else block that prints the converted temperature in a user-friendly format.

Add a finally block that thanks the user for using the weather forecast application, ensuring that this message is displayed regardless of whether an exception was caught or not.

2. The Recipe Ratio Adjuster
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to create a program that adjusts the quantities of a recipe based on the number of servings, handling any type of arithmetic errors or user input exceptions.

Task 1: Start
Ask the user for the number of servings the recipe is originally for and the number of servings they wish to make.

Ensure that the user inputs are valid numbers and handle any ValueError that arises from improper input.

Task 2: Quantity Calculation
Calculate the adjustment factor by dividing the desired servings by the original servings.

Use a try block to catch any arithmetic errors that may occur during the calculation.

Task 3: Serving Success
If the calculation is successful, display the adjusted recipe quantities to the user.

Use a finally block to print a message encouraging the user to enjoy their cooking, regardless of the outcome of the calculation.
